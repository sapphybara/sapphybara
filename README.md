- 👋 Hi, I’m Warren Wiser
- 👀 I’m interested in front-end development and UI/UX design
- 💼 I work at [Pacific Northwest National Laboratory](https://www.pnnl.gov) on React applications and front-end development in Python with Plotly's Dash framework.
- 🌱 I'm directing my focus towards thorough mastery of CSS, no matter how long it takes! It may be a cliche, but it can be so fun and fast if you attempt to properly  understand it (yes I've been there, but is `margin: 0 auto;` _really_ the best way to center an element? 🤷
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the front-end of web applications
- 📫 I'm reachable through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wswiser101/)
- 💻 I'm having a wonderful time learning Figma, I find it a definite upgrade over XD. There is certainly a pretty close tossup between features of both, however.
- 🏫 I'm a senior in Mathematics, with a certificate in Computer Science, at The University of Texas at Austin.
